 Stuck at a blank screen? Let generative AI write the first line for you. 🤖

**Example**

- Write a date‑parsing function: type “convert ‘2025‑10‑03’ to a Date object” and get a ready‑to‑run snippet.
- Debug a crash: paste a log that says “app crashes on login”, the AI spots a null‑pointer (an error that occurs when code tries to use something that isn’t there) and suggests a one‑line fix.
- Generate unit‑test scaffolding for a new API, cutting hours of boilerplate.
- Draft README sections or API docs from a short description, saving writing time.

**What’s generative AI?**

Think of it as a super‑charged autocomplete that can create whole pieces of code, documentation, or tests from a brief prompt—like a chef who whips up a dish from just a few ingredients you mention.

**Takeaway**

Start small: let AI draft repetitive code, scaffold tests, or write docs. Review the output, understand why it works, and you’ll level up faster than typing everything yourself. Expect a 30‑40% reduction in routine work.
